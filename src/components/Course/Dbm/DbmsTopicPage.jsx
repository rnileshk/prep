        <li>
          DBMS stands for Database Management System, a software system that allows users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
          It solves problems found in traditional file systems like redundancy, inconsistency, and lack of security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Components of DBMS:</strong> Includes hardware, software, data, users, and procedures to ensure smooth data operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Functions of DBMS:</strong> Data storage, retrieval, manipulation, backup and recovery, concurrency control, and access management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Types of DBMS:</strong> Hierarchical, Network, Relational, and Object-Oriented models each serve different organizational data needs.

            <li>
              Indexing is a data structure technique that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.
            </li>
            <li>
              It creates a separate data structure that allows quick access to rows in a table based on the values of one or more columns.

            <li>
              Common types of indexes include B-trees, hash indexes, and bitmap indexes.
